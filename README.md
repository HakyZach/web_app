# Overview

The web app that I made provides a number of simple math questions and show the answers when the user chooses to, similar to Quizlet. 
To start a test server I run the "py manage.py runserver" command in command prompt and enter 127.0.0.1:8000 into a web browser's address bar.

My goal in making this app was to learn the basics of the Django framework and create my first web app.

# Web Pages

My app uses two different pages. One holds the questions and links to the other. The other shows the answer for whatever question the corresponding link is for.
# Development Environment

For this software, I made use of the Django framework, which in itself uses the Python and HTML programming languages.

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Allow for randomly generated problems
* Touch up on looks
* Have the user input an answer and check if they're right before seeing the correct one
